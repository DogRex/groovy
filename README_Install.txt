This is Gant a Groovy way of working with Ant tasks -- no more XML :-)

In order to install and use Gant you must have Groovy installed and
the environment variable GROOVY_HOME must be set to the location of a
Groovy installation.  This location is where Gant will be installed.

To install Gant for the first time, you need to have an Ant
installation. Type "ant install", this should do everything necessary
to install the gant/gant.bat scripts in the Groovy bin directory and
gant-<version-number>.jar in the Groovy lib directory.  You are then
able to use Gant.

To install a new release of Gant where one is installed already, you
can, of course (!), do "gant install".
