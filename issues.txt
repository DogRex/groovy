Need some better documentation -- in the source, as manual pages and on teh Groovy website.

In an include statement, if the class name cannot be found then you get a weird error message:

  Caused by: groovy.lang.MissingPropertyException: No such property: org for class: build
          at groovy.lang.MetaClassImpl.getProperty(MetaClassImpl.java:734)


println and print used in a Gant script cause internal MissingMethodException.  Must be a lookup
problem.

Need to trap all exception that might sensibly happen due to reasonable errors in Gant scripts
so that sensible error messages can be issued.

It is irritating to have to have null at the end of a target method if the last real statement
is an ant call.  Is there a way of making Target a synonym for void?

Need to find a way of not having the problem of --targets actually executing ant tasks if there is
no function call before them in the target method.

If there are compilation errors in the Gant file then currently an exception occurs and the line
numbers are wrong.  Need to trap the exception and recalculate the line number to give the right
information to the user.  We add a line at the start and 3 lines at the beginning of the class
before compilation.

Need to create a test suite.

Get the GANTLIB stuff finished so it actually works.  The bits in the Gant source are probably
wrong, this almost certainly needs doing in the shell scripts so that the CLASSPATH is right
before Java starts.  This probably means startingGroovy needs amendment.

If the constructor of a build class is not public then we get a:

Caused by: java.lang.IllegalAccessException: Class gjdk.java.lang.Class_GroovyReflector can not access a member of class build with modifiers "private"
        at sun.reflect.Reflection.ensureMemberAccess(Reflection.java:65)
        at java.lang.Class.newInstance0(Class.java:344)
        at java.lang.Class.newInstance(Class.java:303)
        at gjdk.java.lang.Class_GroovyReflector.invoke(Unknown Source)

which isn't exactly a good error message for the user.
