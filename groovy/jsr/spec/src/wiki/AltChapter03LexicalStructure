*Chapter 3*

h1. Lexical Structure

This chapter specifies the lexical structure of the Groovy programming language. 

Programs are written in Unicode (¤3.1), but lexical translations are provided (¤3.2) so that Unicode escapes (¤3.3) can be used to include any Unicode character using only ASCII characters. 
Line terminators are defined (¤3.4) to support the different conventions of existing host systems while maintaining consistent line numbers. 

The Unicode characters resulting from the lexical translations are reduced to a sequence of input elements (¤3.5), which are white space (¤3.6), comments (¤3.7), and tokens. 
The tokens are the identifiers (¤3.8), keywords (¤3.9), literals (¤3.10), separators (¤3.11), and operators (¤3.12) of the syntactic grammar.

h2. 3.1 Unicode

Programs are written using the Unicode character set.
Information about this character set and its associated character encodings may be found at: 

bq. http://www.unicode.org 

The Java platform tracks the Unicode specification as it evolves. 
The precise version of Unicode used by a given release is specified in the documentation of the class {{Character}}.

Versions of the Groovy programming language up to and including 1.0 final used Unicode version 3.0. 
Upgrades to newer versions of the Unicode Standard occurred in J2SE 5.0 (to Unicode 4.0). 

The Unicode standard was originally designed as a fixed-width 16-bit character encoding. 
It has since been changed to allow for characters whose representation requires more than 16 bits.
