# By default, the Irida (lib/annotations.jar, lib/boot.jar, lib/commons-collections.jar, lib/extensions.jar,
# lib/forms_rt.jar, lib/icons.jar, lib/idea.jar, lib/openapi.jar, lib/picocontainer.jar, lib/trove4j.jar and
# lib/xstream.jar) libraries are expected to be found under the <PLUGIN_HOME>/lib/compile/irida directory.
#
# By uncommenting the definition below, you can get the build to use the libraries in another location such as your idea
# installation. HOWEVER, PLEASE DO NOT CHECK YOUR CUSTOM DEFINITIONS IN AS THEY WOULD LIKELY FAIL THE CONTINUOUS BUILD!
