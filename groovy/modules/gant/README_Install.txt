This is Gant a Groovy way of working with Ant tasks -- no more XML :-)

In order to install and use Gant you must have Groovy installed and the environmnet variable
GROOVY_HOME must indicate the location of the Groovy installation.

To install Gant for the first time type "ant install", this should do everything necessary to
install the gant/gant.bat script in the Groovy bin directory and gant.jar in the Groovy lib
directory.  You are then able to use Gant instead of Ant.

To install a new release of Gant where one is installed already, you can, of course (!), do
"gant install".
