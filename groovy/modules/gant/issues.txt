Need some better documentation -- in the source, as manual pages and on teh Groovy website.

In an include statement, if the class name cannot be found then you get a weird error message:

  Caused by: groovy.lang.MissingPropertyException: No such property: org for class: build
          at groovy.lang.MetaClassImpl.getProperty(MetaClassImpl.java:734)


println and print used in a Gant script cause serious problems.  Must be a lookup problem.  This
also highlights that MissingMethodException can occur in multiple places and these need to be
separated out so as to avoid incorrect errors -- e.g. if println is used in a target then the
error message is that the target doesn't exist.

If there has been an include statement so that there are delegates then looking for a target
that doesn't exist causes infinite recursion and a stack overflow.

Need to trap all exception that might sensibly happen due to reasonable errors in Gant scripts
so that sensible error messages can be issued.

It is irritating to have to have null at the end of a target method if the last real statement
is an ant call.  Is there a way of making Target a synonym for void?

Need to find a way of not having the problem of --tasks actually executing ant tasks if there is
no function call before them in the target method.

If there are compilation errors in the Gant file then currently an exception occurs and the line
numbers are wrong.  Need to trap the exception and recalculate the line number to give the right
information to the user.  We add a line at the start and 3 lines at the beginning of the class
before compilation.

Need to create a test suite.

Get the GANTLIB stuff finished so it actually works.  The bits in the Gant source are probably
wrong, this almost certainly needs doing in the shell scripts so that the CLASSPATH is right
before Java starts.  This probably means startingGroovy needs amendment.
